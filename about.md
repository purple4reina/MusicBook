# About

Rey Abolofia is a clarinetist whose performance and teaching have enriched his
home community of Portland, Oregon. In 2008, he was presented with the Portland
State University President's Award for Outstanding Community Engagement. This
award, the highest offered by the University President, reflected Rey's
volunteer work at public schools, recitals at local nursing homes, and
investment in his clarinet students. In addition to receiving a Master's degree
in Music from Portland State University, magna cum laude, he has also studied
at the Eastman School of Music.

A passionate teacher, Rey has spent many years working with middle school and
high school youth. 2016 marked his tenth consecutive summer as a counselor at
Woodwind Camp at Wallowa Lake. His students have gone on to join the Portland
Youth Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Youth Symphony, receive performance
based scholarships, pursue music at the college level, and compete in the
Oregon State Solo Contest.

Rey has appeared in recitals throughout the United States and in Europe. He
currently performs in and around Portland with the Mozart Trio, the Rose City
Gay Freedom Band, and Classical Revolution PDX.

As well as performing and teaching, Rey has pursued graduate studies in music.
His research has focused on the history of early music, particularly vocal
music of the early 1400s, and the intersection between music theory and
mathematics.
