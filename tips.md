# Tips & Tricks

## Embouchure
Four steps to a great clarinet embouchure:
1. Fast air
1. Flat chin
3. Tight corners
4. High tongue

Air is the most important piece of a good clarinet sound.  It should be strong
and fast, like a laser beam aimed toward the reed.  Engage your abdominal
muscles and push hard.

The chin must be flat like a table and stretched downward as though it is
reaching for your toes.

The back of the tongue should be high in the mouth, as though you are saying
the letter "E".  However the lips should be very circular and tight, as though
you are saying the letter "O".
