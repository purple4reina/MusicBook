Reina Abolofia is a clarinetist whose performance and teaching have enriched her home community of Portland, Oregon. In 2008, she was presented with the Portland State University President's Award for Outstanding Community Engagement. This award, the highest offered by the University President, reflected Reina's volunteer work at public schools, recitals at local nursing homes, and investment in her clarinet students. In addition to receiving a Master's degree in Music from Portland State University, magna cum laude, she has also studied at the Eastman School of Music.

A passionate teacher, Reina has spent many years working with middle school and high school youth. 2016 will mark her tenth consecutive summer as a counselor at Woodwind Camp at Wallowa Lake.  Her students have gone on to join the Portland Youth Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Youth Symphony, receive performance based scholarships, and pursue music at the college level.

She has appeared in recitals throughout the United States and in Europe. She currently performs in and around Portland with the Mozart Trio, the Harrison Hill Chamber Players, and Classical Revolution PDX.

As well as performing and teaching, Reina has pursued graduate studies in music. Her research has focused on the history of early music, particularly vocal music of the early 1400s, and the intersection between music theory and mathematics.
